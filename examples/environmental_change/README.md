# Environmental change

A dynamic example using v2.1 Bioclimate from CHELSA and their projections for climate change under the SSP-RCP7 using the gfdl-esm4 model. Data was downscaled by a factor of 10 to reduce the size of the files. This results in a patch size of about 100 kmÂ². The original data can be downloaded from [CHELSA](http://chelsa-climate.org/downloads/).
