MetaRange is a process-based mechanistic species distribution model, that explicitly includes stochastic as well as metabolic processes. It is intended to be used as a general mechanistic distribution model for theoretical questions as well as a predictive tool to model future species distributions based on empirical data.

This module is an adaptation of the [metaRange](https://srfall.github.io/metaRange) model written in R.
